## 10/31/2025 2 PM - My previous work from the Summer of Making.  

This is some of my previous work from the Summer of Making.
I am posting this so as not to count as Blue Print working hours.
What I worked on back then included 3D modeling of the components of the robot as well as the construction of the prototype board using Raspberry Pi Pico. However, the project had not been completed.

## 10/31/2025 11 PM - New Prototype Board  

Today I built a new prototype and soldered my new board with the ESP32.
It was one of my longest and hardest soldering sessions so far.
The process was quite complex.I had to resolder some parts after realizing I mixed up analog and digital pins for the sensors.
I haven’t tested it with power yet, but I checked continuity with a multimeter, and everything seems connected correctly.
