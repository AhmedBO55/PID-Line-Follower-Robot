## 10/31/2025 - My previous work from the Summer of Making.  

This is some of my previous work from the Summer of Making.
I am posting this so as not to count as Blue Print working hours.
What I worked on back then included 3D modeling of the components of the robot as well as the construction of the prototype board using Raspberry Pi Pico. However, the project had not been completed.
