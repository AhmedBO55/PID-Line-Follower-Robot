## 10/31/2025 2 PM - My previous work from the Summer of Making.  

This is some of my previous work from the Summer of Making.
I am posting this so as not to count as Blue Print working hours.
What I worked on back then included 3D modeling of the components of the robot as well as the construction of the prototype board using Raspberry Pi Pico. However, the project had not been completed.

## 10/31/2025 11 PM - New Prototype Board  

Today I built a new prototype and soldered my new board with the ESP32.
It was one of my longest and hardest soldering sessions so far.
The process was quite complex.I had to resolder some parts after realizing I mixed up analog and digital pins for the sensors.
I haven’t tested it with power yet, but I checked continuity with a multimeter, and everything seems connected correctly.

## 11/2/2025 - Assembly and Motor Testing  

Today, I completed the assembly of the whole robot and spent a great deal of time leveling it, since the wheel diameter, bille libre, and line sensor were not all at the same level. I had to adjust them carefully to everything level out.
Once I was done, I began testing the motors and the TB6612FNG driver. It was my first time using PWM and the enable pins of the TB6612 driver and encountered many small issues, but I got everything worked out as it moved along.
I tested out the motors with the Bluetooth control code and were able to get the motors and TB6612FNG supplier to work properly.
I am still working on getting the QTR sensor to work, so next step is to tackle this.
