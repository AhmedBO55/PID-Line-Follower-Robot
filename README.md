# PID-Line-Follower-Robot
My PID Line Follower Robot is a rebuild and the completion of my summer of making, unfinished, and inshipped, project. In the summer of making, I did the 3d modeling of the robot, and i soldered components in a solder plate, but I've discovered that Raspberry Pico don’t have enough pins, so I stopped and now I am completing this project with ESP32
